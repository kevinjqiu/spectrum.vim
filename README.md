Spectrum.vim
============
I have literally hundreds of colorschemes in [my vim setup](https://github.com/kevinjqiu/vimmy). This little script helps to randomly pick a colorscheme from my vim setup and if I'm lucky, I might find a really good one I may stick with for a long time.

Requirements
============
Vim 7+ and compiled with Python

Default Key binding
===================
* `<Leader>q` - randomly pick a colorscheme
* `<Leader>-` - go back one colorscheme
* `<Leader>+` - go forward one colorscheme
